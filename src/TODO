TODO: 


Things to do: 

Map Editor Sprite Sheet functionality
- off grid rendering

Static Entities
- Test Animations, like trees shaking n shit

__Corrran:__

offtile asset rendering on tilemaps

animation framerate independence

__Braden:__

UI Abstraction (see main.py)
- How do Menus work at the rendering level
- wtf is a loading screen
- How do buttons work
- How can we store the players desired settings on device and load them at runtime
- A future refeactor will require a more thourough handling of user input during the event loop



IDEAS:

DEBUG=1 mode that renders rect hitboxes of all physicsentities
- after first entity rendering pass

DEBUG=2 shows game attributes

DEBUG=3 shows player attributes

map generation


combat mechanics
- spinning is broken into 3 parts: 
  - spin startup
  - spin speed (RPS)
  - spin cooldown



loot 
  - items take NLP generated names from wowItems bigram/MLP project
  - can probably run LSTM on device for cooler names and becuase its funny
